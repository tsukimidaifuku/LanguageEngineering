        Function returning k nearest neighbors with distances for each word in `words`
        
        We suggest using nearest neighbors implementation from scikit-learn 
        (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html). Check
        carefully their documentation regarding the parameters passed to the algorithm.
    
        To describe how the function operates, imagine you want to find 5 nearest neighbors for the words
        "Harry" and "Potter" using some distance metric `m`. 
        For that you would need to call `self.find_nearest(["Harry", "Potter"], k=5, metric='m')`.
        The output of the function would then be the following list of lists of tuples (LLT)
        (all words and distances are just example values):
    
        [[('Harry', 0.0), ('Hagrid', 0.07), ('Snape', 0.08), ('Dumbledore', 0.08), ('Hermione', 0.09)],
         [('Potter', 0.0), ('quickly', 0.21), ('asked', 0.22), ('lied', 0.23), ('okay', 0.24)]]
        
        The i-th element of the LLT would correspond to k nearest neighbors for the i-th word in the `words`
        list, provided as an argument. Each tuple contains a word and a similarity/distance metric.
        The tuples are sorted either by descending similarity or by ascending distance.
        
        :param      words:   Words for the nearest neighbors to be found
        :type       words:   list
        :param      metric:  The similarity/distance metric
